            Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise! We are but maggots,
            writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now
            walk among the stars! But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, "Let me show you the power of Talos
            Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter. I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this
            land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you." Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great
            Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel! And there
            it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from
            flesh, to rule the realm of spirit! The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the
            heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth! Today, they take away your
            faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your
            very lives? And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the
            will of the Thalmor! Against its own people! So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up,
            Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine! For we are the children of
            man! And we shall inherit both the heavens and the earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule
            Skyrim! Forever! Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your
            grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment! And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere
            you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man! Trust in
            me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to
            spread his holy word! </marquee>
